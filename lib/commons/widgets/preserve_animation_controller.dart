/// An AnimationController that preserves its timing even when the device

///
/// This controller is designed to solve the common issue where timers
/// run super fast when users have "Reduce animations" enabled, which
/// can break quiz timers, countdown widgets, and other time-critical animations.
///
/// **When to use:**
/// - Quiz timers that must maintain accurate timing
/// - Countdown widgets
/// - Progress indicators with specific durations
/// - Any animation where timing accuracy is more important than respecting accessibility settings
///
/// **When NOT to use:**
/// - Decorative animations (use regular AnimationController)
/// - UI transitions that should respect accessibility settings
/// - Animations that are purely for visual enhancement
///
/// **Example usage:**
/// ```dart
/// late final timerController = PreserveAnimationController(
///   duration: Duration(seconds: 60),
///   reverseDuration: Duration(seconds: 5),
/// );
/// ```
class PreserveAnimationController extends AnimationController {
  /// Creates an AnimationController that preserves its timing regardless
  /// of system animation settings.

  /// All parameters work the same as [AnimationController] except [vsync]
  /// and [animationBehavior] which are automatically configured to preserve timing.
